# Spotify Clone 🎧

Welcome to **Parv's Spotify Clone**, a full-fledged, interactive music streaming platform built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project replicates the functionality and design of Spotify while incorporating my personal enhancements and creative touch.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This Spotify Clone serves as an independent project showcasing my front-end development skills. The platform includes features like music playback, playlist management, volume controls, and responsive design. All data is stored locally using **localStorage**, making it a lightweight and self-contained application.

The goal of this project is to deliver a real-world application experience, both in terms of functionality and design, using pure JavaScript for all logic.

   - Clicking "Play" initializes the audio playback, while "Next" and "Previous" buttons control navigation between songs.

### 2. **Playlist Management**
   - Users can add or remove songs from their custom playlists.
   - All data is automatically synced and saved in localStorage.

### 3. **UI Interactions**
   - Fully interactive buttons, sliders, and cards make for a seamless user experience.
   - Responsive design ensures compatibility across all screen sizes.

### 4. **LocalStorage**
   - Key-value pairs store songs, playlists, and settings persistently in the browser.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to:
1. Deepen my understanding of JavaScript, especially DOM manipulation and event handling.
2. Implement **localStorage** for real-world data persistence.
3. Work with responsive layouts to optimize the user experience across devices.
4. Develop an organized and scalable codebase for a single-page application (SPA).
